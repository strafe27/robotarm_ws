# robotarm_ws

Apply forward kinematics and inverse kinematics using the robot arm's URDF file. This repo made specifically for Yahboom DOFBOT 6-DoF robot arm and may or may not work with other robot arms. 

This program uses ROS Noetic on Linux 20.04.

This repo was created to build the project below for my final year project. Robot arm used for colour sorting. Build the software and programs from the group up.
